# ASMG_database

The ASMG database tool serves as a bridge between various kinds of Cow data
files. It automatically analyzes the structure and
content of the imported files and generates corresponding SQL tables with appropriate data
types and relationships. Once the files are converted into SQL tables, the Database Generator
Tool offers a range of functionalities for data manipulation. Users can perform operations such
as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and joining tables, all through the user-friendly Tkinter GUI.
This eliminates the need for complex SQL queries and empowers users with a visual interface to
interact with the data more intuitively.
